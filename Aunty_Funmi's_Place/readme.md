## Background  
Aunty Funmi’s Place required a structured tool to systematically gather customer feedback and translate it into actionable business insights. The survey design ensured clear question logic, minimized bias, and aligned directly with key business objectives.  

## Objectives  
The objectives of the survey design were to:
