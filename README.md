# CX_Survey_Design
Welcome to my CX Survey Design Portfolio! This project showcases the design of structured customer experience surveys, highlighting questionnaire development, rationale for each question, and alignment with business objectives to capture actionable customer insights.


## Project Structure  

Each survey design folder includes the following components:  
- **Executive Summary:** A high-level overview highlighting the key findings and outcomes of the survey.  
- **Background:** Context that explains why the survey was conducted and the business problem it addresses.  
- **Objective:** The specific goals the survey aims to achieve and the questions it seeks to answer.
- **Sampling Strategy:** How the data was collected from customers. 
- **Survey Design & Rationale:** Explains the purpose behind each question, ensuring that every item in the questionnaire directly supports the business objectives and insight goals.
- **Survey Recources:** Provides supporting materials such as the exported form, logic flow, and sampling notes to give full transparency into how the survey was structured and implemented.
