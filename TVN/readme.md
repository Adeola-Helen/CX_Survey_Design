# Customer Satisfaction Survey Design – TVN  

## Executive Summary  
This project documents the design of a structured **customer satisfaction survey** for TVN beverages. The survey was conducted after the product was launched in the market to capture customer perceptions around taste, value for money, availability, and loyalty. It also explored areas for product improvement and substitution behavior, providing actionable insights for marketing, product refinement, and distribution strategies.  

## Background  
TVN had already introduced its product into the market but needed to evaluate how well it was being received by customers. To remain competitive in the beverage industry, understanding satisfaction levels, perceived value, and customer loyalty was essential. The survey was designed to measure the product’s performance in real market conditions, highlighting both strengths and areas needing adjustment.

## Objectives  
The objectives of the survey design were to:  
- Assess customer satisfaction with **taste and quality**.  
- Measure whether customers perceive TVN as good **value for money**.  
- Test demand for product innovation (e.g., larger pack sizes).  
- Identify **availability challenges** and distribution gaps.  
- Gather direct customer feedback on **improvements**.  
- Measure loyalty and advocacy through a **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** question.  
- Understand **competitive substitution patterns** when TVN is not available.  
- Capture customer **dislikes** to refine pricing, quality, and overall experience.

## Sampling Strategy  

The survey was distributed through **product distributors** who had direct access to TVN customers at the point of sale. This ensured that feedback was collected from actual users who had recently interacted with the product. To encourage participation and improve response quality, customers were asked to fill the forms immediately after purchase and were given a small incentive as appreciation for their time. This approach provided a reliable snapshot of **real-time customer satisfaction**, grounded in authentic product experiences rather than hypothetical responses.  


## Survey Design & Rationale  

As part of this project, I designed a focused survey to assess how customers experienced TVN in the market. Each question was carefully structured to capture feedback that could directly inform business decisions.  

1. **How well does TVN taste?**  
   Taste is the most important driver of satisfaction for beverages. This question measured how customers rated the flavor profile of an already-launched product.  

2. **How would you rate the value for money for TVN?**  
   Affordability is central to repeat purchase behavior. This question helped determine whether customers feel the product is priced fairly given its quality and benefits.  

3. **Would you prefer that TVN comes in a larger pack?**  
   Packaging impacts convenience and sales volume. This question tested whether customers were looking for a larger pack size option to better meet their needs.  

4. **Is TVN easily available in your area?**  
   Even satisfied customers cannot buy a product they can’t find. This question identified gaps in distribution and accessibility.  

5. **What sort of improvement would you love to see in TVN?**  
   Direct customer suggestions were captured here to inform product refinements, such as taste adjustments, sweetness levels, or improvements in quality.  

6. **How likely is it that you recommend TVN to a friend or colleague?**  
   This standard Net Promoter Score (NPS) question measured customer loyalty and brand advocacy for the product already in circulation.  

7. **What alternative beverage would you choose if TVN is not available?**  
   Understanding substitution behavior provides insight into TVN’s competitive set. This helped identify whether customers leaned toward sodas, juices, or other beverages in its absence.  

8. **What do you dislike about TVN?**  
   This question highlighted pain points, such as pricing concerns, fermentation issues, or excess sweetness, so the business could address barriers to satisfaction and retention.  

By structuring the survey in this way, the business was able to capture real-world customer feedback that reflected both product acceptance and opportunities for improvement in branding, pricing, and distribution.
